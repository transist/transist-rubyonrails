Ruby on Rails for Developers
============================

![Transi.st](https://github.com/transist/transist-rubyonrails/raw/master/images/logo_small.png "Transi.st")

This course teaches experienced developers [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org) and [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/). It's designed to be taught by a practicing rubyist and a teaching assistant. Both individuals must have expert understanding of Ruby, Rack and Ruby on Rails. The ideal class size is 12-15 students, each having prior application development track record. The lesson plan is conceived as 12 two-hour lectures with homework given after each of the first 6 courses. Assignments are tracked in [Pivotal Tracker](http://pivotaltracker.com). Subsequent 6 lectures alternate class material with coding. The course ends with 8 hours of building a final project for obtaining certification.

These materials were developed for General Assembly's class: Ruby on Rails for Developers. To apply to take the next itearation of this class through GA visit: [Rails for Dev @ GA](https://generalassemb.ly/ruby-on-rails-for-devs)


Class Material
--------------

We start by introducing students to the Ruby development environment and show elementary Ruby code. Students also learn how to use Git and exercise the development workflow via [Github](http://github.com), including pull requests and topic branches. We dive into Ruby basics and conclude with object-oriented features, mixins and exception handling.

After the class gains enough familiarity with the language features, we teach [Rack](http://rack.github.com/), an essential foundation of any solid Ruby on Rails knowledge. The instructor builds a basic web application that serves static files from the file system with Rack. A Rails application is then assembled from scratch without the use of Rails generators. Tests are written with the default unit test infrastructure, and once again using behavior-driven development with [RSpec](http://rspec.info/). The application is deployed on [Heroku](http://www.heroku.com/).

We step aside to teach Ruby meta-programming before lecturing on ActiveRecord, ERB, HAML and SASS. The instructor then builds authentication without using an off-the-shelf library. This combination of technologies gives the students the necessary tools to build a complete project, which is typically introduced around the 6th lecture. When this material was developed we asked the students to build a Ruby on Rails clone of the popular [Stashboard](http://www.stashboard.org/) application.

Final lectures include RESTful APIs with Rails and [Grape](https://github.com/intridea/grape), an introduction to NoSQL databases with [MongoDB](http://mongodb.org). We also recommend you offer students an opportunity to revisit any topic that was insufficiently clear or lecture on a topic that they are curious about.
